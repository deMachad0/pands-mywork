Week 01: 

A program called helloworld.py

The program displays Hello World!

Week 02:

The program Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
Add the two amounts and Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.

A program called accounts.py 

The program that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).

Week 04: 

A program called collatz.py

A program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.

this website contributes a lot in learning how to generate a date time and transform it in intenger

Week 06:

Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
Create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).

Week 07: 

Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. Think about what is being asked here, document any assumptions you are making.
The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. I have not shown you how to do this, you need to look it up.

Handling with Unicode UTF-8 
And using a readline() to extract the title of the book

Week 08: 

Write a program called plottask.py that displays:
A histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
and a plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, on the one set of axes.
